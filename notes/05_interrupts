- type alias is just giving an existing type a new name, under the hood they are 
the exact same type, eg:
    type Kilometers = i32;
    the Kilometers type is the exact same type as i32, its a synonym for it

type HandlerFunc = extern "x86-interrupt" fn(_: InterruptStackFrame);
means we are assinging HandlerFunc the same type as RHS 
which btw is using the syntax of extern "C" fn; to signify a foreign function 
using the C calling convention, but here we are saying its a foreign function 
using the "x86-interrupt" calling convention

-int3 is the name of the breakpoint instruction
(actually, why can we call 
x86_64::instructions::interrupts::int3();
without importing it with use or mod, even if 
we declared it in cargo.toml?)
