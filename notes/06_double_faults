- how does lazy static work under the hood?
- double fault handler is divering (never returns) 
because x86 architecture does not allow returning from 
this exception

- whats usize?
- idt = interrupt descriptor table
- ist = interrupt stack table
- tss = task state segment
- gdt = global descriptor table

what is tail recursive fn?
it just means a fn that recurses AND has the last computation of the fn being the recursive step
- this is important because it allows the compiler to optimize the recursion and reducing overhead/
prevent staccc overflows
